# Neural RPS Project Summary

## Project Overview

This project explores the application of neural networks and evolutionary algorithms to the Rock-Paper-Scissors card game. We've implemented several AI approaches:

1. **AlphaGo-style** - Combining neural networks with Monte Carlo Tree Search
2. **NEAT Evolution** - Using NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies for continuous improvement
3. **Random Baseline** - Simple random move selection as a control

The goal is to develop strong agents for the RPS card game while comparing different neural network training methodologies.

## Current Implementation Status

### Tournament System

We've developed a comprehensive ELO-based tournament system that:

- Pits different AI models against each other
- Tracks performance using ELO ratings
- Automatically prunes underperforming agents
- Generates detailed statistics and matchup analysis
- Supports various agent types (AlphaGo, NEAT, Random)

### Training Approaches

#### AlphaGo-style Training
- Self-play to generate training examples
- Policy network to predict move probabilities
- Value network to evaluate board positions
- Integration with MCTS for improved decision making
- Configurable network sizes and training parameters

#### NEAT Evolution
- Population-based training with speciation
- Evolving both policy and value networks
- Parallel evaluation for improved performance
- Generation-by-generation improvement tracking
- Continuous model checkpointing

### Models and Results

We've trained and evolved numerous models, including:
- AlphaGo models with various hidden layer sizes (64-256 neurons)
- NEAT evolved networks across 30 generations
- Extended training for top-performing models

Our tournament results have shown:
- Competitive performance between different approaches
- Surprisingly strong performance from the Random baseline in some scenarios
- Progressive improvement across NEAT generations
- Effectiveness of extended training on previously strong models

## Improvement Plans

### 1. Graceful Exit & Checkpoint System

We've designed a robust system for handling training interruptions:
- Signal handling for safe termination
- Regular checkpointing of training state
- Detailed progress reporting
- Ability to resume training from checkpoints
- Comprehensive training reports

### 2. Minimax Analyzer Implementation

We're developing a minimax-based analyzer to:
- Provide objective evaluation of model quality
- Compare neural decisions to theoretically optimal moves
- Create benchmark positions for consistent testing
- Identify strengths and weaknesses in different training approaches
- Offer insights into the game's strategic depth

### 3. Training Process Improvements

Future enhancements to the training process include:
- More efficient parallel evaluation
- Better progress visualization
- Adaptive hyperparameter tuning
- Integration of minimax insights without biasing learning
- More comprehensive model comparison metrics

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Implement the minimax analyzer core functionality
2. Create benchmark position suite for evaluation
3. Integrate graceful exit handling into training processes
4. Run more comprehensive tournaments with extended-trained models

### Medium-term Goals
1. Develop hybrid approaches combining NEAT and AlphaGo strengths
2. Implement the PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) approach
3. Create visualization tools for neural decision making
4. Build a comprehensive evaluation framework for comparing approaches

### Long-term Vision
1. Extend techniques to more complex games
2. Explore transfer learning between similar games
3. Develop meta-learning approaches to game strategy
4. Create general-purpose game learning framework

## Conclusion

The Neural RPS project has successfully implemented and compared multiple AI approaches for the RPS card game. Our work with NEAT and AlphaGo-style implementations has provided valuable insights into evolutionary and self-play approaches to game learning.

The addition of the minimax analyzer will further enhance our understanding of model quality and game strategy, while improvements to training processes will make our development more efficient and robust.

Through this project, we continue to explore the fascinating intersection of neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and game theory.
