# MCTS Migration to GPU

## Current Status

We're working on refactoring the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) implementation to properly support both CPU and GPU-accelerated versions. The main goals are:

1. Enable both CPU and GPU implementations to coexist
2. Fix dependency issues with TensorFlow (removed)
3. Improve the architecture using interfaces
4. Make the neural service run on port 50052 instead of 50051

## Progress So Far

### Neural Service

- ✅ Updated the neural service to use port 50052 (avoiding conflict with system service)
- ✅ Added proper shutdown mechanism for the neural service
- ✅ Verified that PyTorch service works properly with test clients
- ✅ Removed TensorFlow dependencies from the codebase

### MCTS Architecture

We've developed a new adapter-based architecture to allow for cleaner separation between:
- Game state interface
- Agent interface
- Concrete implementations

The new architecture uses:
- A separate `mcts_adapter` package to avoid conflicts with existing code
- Interface-based design for proper abstraction and future extensibility
- Adapter pattern to wrap existing implementations

### Benchmark Tool

- ✅ Updated benchmark_gpu_mcts.go to use our new adapter package
- ✅ Successfully built and ran a simplified benchmark test

## Remaining Issues

1. **Type Compatibility Issues**: There are still type compatibility issues between the adapter interfaces and the original implementations:
   - The game state `Clone()` method returns different types (concrete vs interface)
   - Redeclared types in the original MCTS package

2. **Implementation Gaps**: 
   - CPU implementation adapter is not yet complete
   - Need better integration between original MCTS code and the adapter layer

## Plan Forward

1. **Fix Interface Compatibility**:
   - Update the `RPSCardGame.Clone()` method to work with our interfaces
   - Create a specialized adapter for the existing GPU implementation

2. **Complete Implementation**:
   - Finish implementing the CPU version adapter
   - Consider simplifying the adapter layer if issues persist

3. **Testing**:
   - Run comparative tests between CPU and GPU implementations
   - Ensure performance benchmarks are accurate
   - Validate output equivalence between implementations

4. **Integration**:
   - Once working, update the training tools to use the new architecture
   - Set up a tournament system to compare different agent implementations

## Next Steps

1. Fix the `Clone()` method compatibility issue in the adapter package
2. Update the GPU adapter to properly handle type conversions
3. Complete a minimal CPU implementation adapter 
4. Run comparative benchmarks to validate the approach
