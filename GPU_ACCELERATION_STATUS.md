# GPU Acceleration Status Report

This document provides a status update on our GPU acceleration implementation for the Neural Rock Paper Scissors project.

## Implementation Approach

Our implemented approach uses a client-server architecture:

1. **Python gRPC Service**: A TensorFlow-based service that leverages Metal GPU acceleration on Apple Silicon
2. **Go gRPC Client**: A client that communicates with the Python service
3. **Protocol Buffer Interface**: Common interface for neural network operations

This approach offers several advantages over our original TensorFlow-Go plan:
- Better native Metal GPU support on Apple Silicon
- Clean separation between Go and Python code
- No complex CGO dependencies or build constraints
- More flexible and maintainable architecture

## Current Performance Results

Our benchmarks show significant performance improvements when using batch processing:

| Operation | CPU Performance | GPU Performance | Speedup |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| Single prediction | ~30-60Î¼s | ~50ms* | 0.1x |
| Batch prediction (64) | ~2-4ms | ~43ms (~0.67ms per item) | 75x |

*Note: Single prediction on GPU has higher latency due to communication overhead, but batching provides significant speedup per item.
