Neural RPS Game Comparison Summary
=========================================

This summary compares the performance of all three implementations
against the same sequence of opponent moves.

C++ Implementation: Game Statistics
C++ Implementation: ===================================================
C++ Implementation: Total Moves: 10
C++ Implementation: Wins: 10
C++ Implementation: Losses: 0
C++ Implementation: Ties: 0
C++ Implementation: Win Rate: 100.00%

Go Implementation: Game Statistics
Go Implementation: ===================================================
Go Implementation: Total Moves: 10
Go Implementation: Wins: 10
Go Implementation: Losses: 0
Go Implementation: Ties: 0
Go Implementation: Win Rate: 100.00%

Legacy C++ Implementation: Game Statistics
Legacy C++ Implementation: ===================================================
Legacy C++ Implementation: Total Moves: 10
Legacy C++ Implementation: Wins: 10
Legacy C++ Implementation: Losses: 0
Legacy C++ Implementation: Ties: 0
Legacy C++ Implementation: Win Rate: 100.00%

Key Observations:
----------------
- All models use the optimal counter-strategy (Paper vs Rock, Scissors vs Paper, Rock vs Scissors)
- The win rate should be 100% for all models since they all use the optimal counter-strategy
- Any differences would be due to variations in the implementation
