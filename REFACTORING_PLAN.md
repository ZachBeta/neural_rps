# Neural RPS Project Refactoring Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to refactor and reorganize the Neural RPS project to establish clear boundaries between different implementations, clarify integration points, and improve documentation.

## 1. Current Issues

The project currently has several organizational issues:

- **Blurred Boundaries**: The line between `alphago_demo` and `golang_implementation` has become unclear with shared functionality.
- **Duplicated Functionality**: Tournament code and agent implementations appear in multiple places.
- **Confusing Integration Points**: How the different packages interact is not well-documented.
- **Overlapping Build System**: Multiple Makefiles with similar targets create confusion about where to run commands.
- **Inconsistent Documentation**: Documentation is scattered and doesn't clearly explain the project architecture.

## 2. Refactoring Goals

1. **Clear Package Boundaries**: Define explicit responsibilities for each implementation.
2. **Simplified Integration**: Make integration points explicit, well-documented, and clean.
3. **Consolidated Build System**: Rationalize the build and run commands.
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Document the design decisions and architecture.
5. **Testable Integration**: Ensure cross-package functionality is properly tested.

## 3. Package Responsibilities

### 3.1. alphago_demo

Primary focus: **Monte Carlo Tree Search + Neural Network implementations for board games**

- **Core Components**:
  - Game state definitions for Tic-Tac-Toe and RPS Card Game
  - AlphaGo-style neural networks (policy and value networks)
  - MCTS algorithm implementation
  - Self-play training infrastructure
  - Model saving/loading functionality

- **Exported APIs**:
  - Neural network models and interfaces
  - Game state interfaces
  - MCTS implementation

### 3.2. golang_implementation

Primary focus: **PPO and other RL approaches for RPS, with tournament functionality**

- **Core Components**:
  - RPS Card Game environment
  - PPO agent implementation
  - Agent interfaces for all agent types
  - Tournament system for comparing agents

- **Integration Points**:
  - AlphaGo agent adapter (using alphago_demo neural networks)
  - Model loading from alphago_demo outputs
  - Game state conversion between formats

## 4. Refactoring Steps

### A. Code Organization

1. **Define Package Boundaries**
   - [x] Document clear responsibilities for each package
   - [x] Move duplicated functionality to its primary location
   - [x] Create adapter patterns for cross-package integration

2. **Consolidate Tournament Code**
   - [x] Keep all tournament logic in `golang_implementation`
   - [x] Ensure adapters allow alphago_demo models to participate in tournaments
   - [x] Document tournament mechanisms and interfaces

3. **Standardize Directory Structure**
   - [ ] Define consistent output directories for models and results
   - [ ] Organize test data consistently

### B. Build System

1. **Root Makefile**
   - [x] Simplify to basic build, run, test commands
   - [x] Use consistent naming convention for targets
   - [x] Add clear documentation for each target
   - [x] Delegate complex functionality to package-specific makefiles

2. **Package-Specific Makefiles**
   - [ ] Ensure each implementation has complete targets for its functionality
   - [ ] Use prefixes to avoid confusion (e.g., `alphago-train` vs `golang-train`)
   - [ ] Document all targets clearly

### C. Interface Definitions

1. **Agent Interface**
   - [ ] Define a common agent interface:
     ```go
     type Agent interface {
         Name() string
         GetMove(gameState GameState) (Move, error)
     }
     ```

2. **Game State Interface**
   - [ ] Define a common game state interface:
     ```go
     type GameState interface {
         Copy() GameState
         GetValidMoves() []Move
         MakeMove(move Move) error
         IsGameOver() bool
         GetWinner() Player
     }
     ```

3. **Model Interface**
   - [ ] Define common model interfaces for saving/loading

### D. Documentation

1. **Project-Level Documentation**
   - [x] Main README with clear project structure
   - [ ] Architecture document with diagrams
   - [ ] Integration guide for cross-package functionality

2. **Package-Specific Documentation**
   - [x] Package READMEs with clear responsibilities
   - [ ] API documentation for public interfaces
   - [x] Integration examples and adapters

3. **Code Comments**
   - [x] Document integration points in code
   - [x] Explain adapter patterns and conversions
   - [ ] Add examples where helpful

## 5. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Organization & Documentation ✓

- [x] Update main README with clear project structure
- [x] Document integration points in code comments
- [x] Clarify package responsibilities in package READMEs
- [x] Simplify root Makefile

### Phase 2: Interface Refinement

- [ ] Define consistent agent interfaces between packages
- [ ] Standardize game state interfaces
- [ ] Create clear adapter patterns for integration
- [ ] Document interfaces in an interfaces.md file

### Phase 3: Build System Consolidation

- [ ] Rationalize build targets across makefiles
- [ ] Create consistent naming for similar operations
- [ ] Ensure all targets are properly documented
- [ ] Create a build_system.md guide

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation

- [ ] Add integration tests for cross-package functionality
- [ ] Verify build system works consistently
- [ ] Create example workflows showing correct usage
- [ ] Add CI configuration for testing

## 7. Completed Work

The following refactoring steps have already been completed:

1. **Simplified the root Makefile** with clearer targets
2. **Updated the main README.md** to clarify the project organization
3. **Added documentation to the AlphaGo agent adapter** explaining integration
4. **Updated the golang_implementation README.md** to document relationship with alphago_demo
5. **Added comments to the alphago_vs_alphago tournament code** to explain dependencies

## 8. Next Steps

The immediate next steps in the refactoring process are:

1. Create ARCHITECTURE.md document with diagrams showing integration
2. Define and document consistent interfaces between packages
3. Add integration tests for cross-package functionality
4. Complete documentation of the build system

## 9. Long-Term Improvements

After the initial refactoring, these improvements should be considered:

1. **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardize error types and handling
2. **Logging Framework**: Add structured logging across implementations
3. **Configuration System**: Unified approach to configuration
4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Add benchmarks to compare implementations
5. **Containerization**: Add Docker support for easier deployment

## 10. Conclusion

This refactoring plan aims to transform the Neural RPS project into a well-organized, clearly documented suite of implementations that showcase different approaches to neural network-based game playing. The end result will be a codebase that is easier to understand, extend, and maintain.
