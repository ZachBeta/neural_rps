Key Observations:
----------------
- All models use the optimal counter-strategy against any opponent move
- Against fixed or biased patterns, all models achieve 100% win rate
- Against a mimicking opponent, models should establish a winning pattern

Strategy Analysis:
-----------------
1. Fixed pattern: The models perfectly counter each move
2. Biased rock: Models mostly play paper, leading to high win rates
3. Biased paper: Models mostly play scissors, leading to high win rates
4. Biased scissors: Models mostly play rock, leading to high win rates
5. Mimicking: An interesting test of whether the model can escape potential cycles
